# sem3full
1. Currently sem3full folder is your latest local folder in sync with git
2. git status - This tells you about the current status of this branch (main branch)
3. Now whenever you will make a change to any file/folder in sem3full, it will show in git status
4. If say you make 5 changes to 5 files but you only want to push 4 changes made to 4 files, then you can use git add <path to file change that you want to push>, so in this case you will run this 4 times for the 4 files  you want to push
5. If you want to push all the changes made then git add .
6. Once you do git add, your changes move into the staging area but they have not reached git yet
7. Next, you need to commit your changes to the local repository, this is done using git commit -m <message that you want to give>
8. Next, you need to push your changes to the remote repository, this is done using git push
